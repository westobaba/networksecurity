🛡️ Network Security: Phishing Detection Pipeline

A complete end-to-end MLOps project for detecting phishing URLs using machine learning and deploying the model through a Dockerized FastAPI application.
This project demonstrates ETL pipelines, data validation, model training with MLflow tracking, and artifact management using AWS S3 — providing a real-world network security ML workflow.

🚀 Key Features

Data Engineering (ETL):
Extracts, transforms, and loads phishing data from network sources.
Cleans, validates, and prepares data for model training.

Data Validation:
Ensures incoming data conforms to defined schemas (data_schema/).

Model Training & Tracking:
Uses MLflow for experiment tracking and model versioning.
Models and metrics are automatically logged and stored.

Artifact Management:
Trained models and ML artifacts are pushed to AWS S3.

FastAPI Inference App:
Serves predictions through a lightweight and scalable API.

Dockerized Deployment:
End-to-end reproducible environment using Docker.

🧩 Workflow Overview

Data Ingestion

Source data is pulled using push_data.py from phishing data repositories or MongoDB.

Data schema validation ensures only clean data proceeds to training.

Feature Engineering & Validation

Data is transformed and stored in valid_data/.

Schema and integrity checks are performed via data_schema/.

Model Training

Run main.py to train the model.

MLflow logs metrics, parameters, and model artifacts to mlruns/.

Best model is exported to final_model/ and uploaded to S3.

Deployment (FastAPI + Docker)

FastAPI app (app.py) loads the latest model from S3/local storage.

Build Docker image and run container for inference.

⚙️ Installation & Setup
1. Clone Repository
git clone https://github.com/westobaba/networksecurity-phishing.git
cd networksecurity-phishing

2. Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
# or
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

3. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Configure AWS & MongoDB

Add your credentials in environment variables or a .env file:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_bucket
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...

🐳 Docker Deployment
Build Docker Image
docker build -t phishing-detector .

Run Docker Container
docker run -p 8080:8080 phishing-detector


Visit the API at 👉 http://localhost:8080

📈 MLflow Tracking

Start MLflow UI to view experiments:

mlflow ui --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db


Then open http://localhost:5000
 to explore logged runs, metrics, and models.

🧪 Example Prediction

Request:

curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/predict" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"url": "http://suspicious-example.com/login"}'


Response:

{
  "url": "http://suspicious-example.com/login",
  "prediction": "Phishing",
  "confidence": 0.97
}
